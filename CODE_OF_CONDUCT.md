Code of conduct
====

We expect Pharo community members to act professionally and respectfully, and we expect our social spaces to be safe and dignified environments.

Specifically:

- Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
- Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
- Listen. Consider and acknowledge people’s points before responding.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Pharo project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate. We will not tolerate harassment from anyone in the Pharo community.

If you are subject to, accused of, or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please [email us](mailto:board@pharo.org).
