I represent a Stream that accesses a FilePage from a File. One use for my instance is to access larger "virtual Strings" than can be stored contiguously in main memory. I restrict the objects stored and retrieved to be Integers or Characters. An end of file pointer terminates reading; it can be extended by writing past it, or the file can be explicitly truncated.
	
To use the file system for most applications, you typically create a FileStream. This is done by sending a message to a FileDirectory (file:, oldFile:, newFile:, rename:newName:) which creates an instance of me. Accesses to the file are then done via my instance.

*** On DOS, files cannot be shortened!  ***  To overwrite a file with a shorter one, first delete the old file (FileDirectory deleteFilePath: 'Hard Disk:aFolder:dataFolder:foo') or (aFileDirectory deleteFileNamed: 'foo').  Then write your new shorter version.
