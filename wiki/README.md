# PharoWiki
Welcome to Pharo wiki. This is a wiki for Pharo. Its purpose is not to replace the Pharo books but rather serve as a quick and dirty way to document things without any setup. 

## How to Contribute
If you are a SquareBracketsAsssociates contributor you alredy set to go. There is no need to clone this repo because we use simple readme files with markdown syntax you can do all your edits online directly using the github interface but if you prefer using your own editor you can also clone this repo and proceed into editing and adding files. There is nothing special, just standard github workflow. We try to keep it as simple as possible and as unofficial as possible. This means that even if you think your contribution is insignigicant , too small, too stupid, too whatever ... thats just an excuse for not contributing. The purpose is not to make a perfect wiki but rather a wiki that can act as a notepad of ideas that we can later add to the contents of one of the Pharo books. if you are new to markdown you can find a tutorial about it [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
