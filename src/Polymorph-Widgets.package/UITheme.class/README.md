Common superclass for User Interface themes. Provides methods for creating new morphs in a standard way, various "services" like a file dialog, message dialogs etc. and also methods for customising aspects of the appearance of various morphs.
Though conceptually abstract, no code is "missing". Subclasses, therefore, should override the aspects they wish to change.
