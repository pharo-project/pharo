An encoder for the V3 bytecode set augmented with the following bytecodes that are part of the full closure implementation.
	138   10001010 jkkkkkkk		Push (Array new: kkkkkkk) (j = 0)
								or	Pop kkkkkkk elements into: (Array new: kkkkkkk) (j = 1)

This is an exact duplicate of EncoderForLongFormV3PlusClosures.
Could be a trait (or in Newspeak, a Mixin).
For now we impose upon you to synchronise any and all changes between these two classes.
