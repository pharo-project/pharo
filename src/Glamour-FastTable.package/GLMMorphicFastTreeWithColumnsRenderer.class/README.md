I am a Morphic renderer for a GLMFastTreeTablePresentation. My main responsability is  to configure the table specific aspects of the presentation (columns, insets) and delegate to the appropriate data source.

Description
--------------------

I use a GLMFastTreeTableDataSource to manage the data of the tree with columns.
I will configure the renderer and the data source  based on a GLMFastTreeTablePresentation.
