This is the abstract class for container-based elements.
Elements are separated in groups by kind (e.g classes, methods, pools, etc.)
Subclasses have to define the kind of collection for a particular group of entities.
For a container the use of a dictionary or another collection (e.g. SortedCollection) to store group of elements is independent.
