I represent special context menu of left side bar in text editors.

Currently this bar is known as #textSegmentIcons ruler in the Rubric editor. It shows various iconic tips about source code. 
I provide context menu by cmd+click or right click on this Rubric area: I build normal context menu with commands annotated by me.
