"
I present a low-level protocol for interacting with filesystems. I hold a reference to
a store (a subinstance of FileSystemStore) which takes care of the details of performing 
file and directory operations on the filesystem I represent. 

I am responsible for resolving all paths that
I pass into my store. My store acts as a factory and offers platform specific actions.


FileSystem instances know two methods that return a Reference object: workingDirectory and root.

FileSystem disk workingDirectory
FileSystem disk root
