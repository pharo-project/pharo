Checks that all classes that have class instance variables also have an initialize method. This makes sure that all class instance variables are initialized properly when the class is filed-into a new image. Having well initialized instance variables also make sure that clients can rely on default values and to not have to spread their code with ifNil statement and cumbersome logic.
