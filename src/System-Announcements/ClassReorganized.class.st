"
This announcement corresponds to the ReorganizedEvent, which seems to (by looking at the references of ReorganizedEvent) be raised when:
- we rename a protocol (see 'renameCategory:toBe: '). if The category is not empty, SystemMethodRecategorizedAnnouncement will also be emitted
- we sort (modify the order of) protocols (see 'sortCategories')
- we add a protocol (see 'addCategory:before:')
- we remove a protocol (see 'removeCategory:' 'removeEmptyCategories')
