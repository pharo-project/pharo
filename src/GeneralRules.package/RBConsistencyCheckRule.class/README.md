Checks for code using equality tests instead of the message sends. Since the code "aCollection size = 0" works for all objects, it is more difficult for someone reading such code to determine that "aCollection" is a collection. Whereas, if you say "aCollection isEmpty" then aCollection must be a collection since isEmpty is only defined for collections.
