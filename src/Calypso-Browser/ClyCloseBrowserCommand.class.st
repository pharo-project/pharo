I am a command to close browser window. 

There are already system shortcuts like `$w` command to close current window. But some morphs like tab manager are implementing it differently.
In a browser the desired behaviour is to close the full window instead of single tab. 
I override it by shortcut activator for source code context. 
When you edit code and press `$w` command"" I will close browser window. 
Also it fixes the case for method browser managed by tabs group window. 
Before `$w` command, it keeps an empty tab without closing it.
