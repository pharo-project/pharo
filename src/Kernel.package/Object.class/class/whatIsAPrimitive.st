	"Some messages in the system are responded to primitively. A primitive   
	response is performed directly by the interpreter rather than by evaluating   
	expressions in a method. The methods for these messages indicate the   
	presence of a primitive response by including <primitive: xx> or 
	<primitive: 79 error: ec>before the first expression in the method.   
	
	In the second case, ec is a special temporary variable that holds an error code. 
	In the VM primitive, failure is indicated by a variable called primFailCode being 
	non-zero. On activating a method with a failing primitive, if the index is in 
	bounds of the 	primitiveFailCodes array in the VMspecialObjectsArray then the 
	failure code substitutes the symbol in the 	primitiveFailCodes array, otherwise 
	it supplies the integer value.
	  
	Primitives exist for several reasons. Certain basic or 'primitive' 
	operations cannot be performed in any other way. Smalltalk without 
	primitives can move values from one variable to another, but cannot add two 
	SmallIntegers together. Many methods for arithmetic and comparison 
	between numbers are primitives. Some primitives allow Smalltalk to 
	communicate with I/O devices such as the disk, the display, and the keyboard. 
	Some primitives exist only to make the system run faster; each does the same 
	thing as a certain Smalltalk method, and its implementation as a primitive is 
	optional.  
	  
	When the Smalltalk interpreter begins to execute a method which specifies a 
	primitive response, it tries to perform the primitive action and to return a 
	result. If the routine in the interpreter for this primitive is successful, 
	it will return a value and the expressions in the method will not be evaluated. 
	If the primitive routine is not successful, the primitive 'fails', and the 
	Smalltalk expressions in the method are executed instead. These 
	expressions are evaluated as though the primitive routine had not been 
	called.  
	  
	The Smalltalk code that is evaluated when a primitive fails usually 
	anticipates why that primitive might fail. If the primitive is optional, the 
	expressions in the method do exactly what the primitive would have done (See 
	Number @). If the primitive only works on certain classes of arguments, the 
	Smalltalk code tries to coerce the argument or appeals to a superclass to find 
	a more general way of doing the operation (see SmallInteger +). If the 
	primitive is never supposed to fail, the expressions signal an error (see 
	SmallInteger asFloat).  
	  
	Each method that specifies a primitive has a comment in it. If the primitive is 
	optional, the comment will say 'Optional'. An optional primitive that is not 
	implemented always fails, and the Smalltalk expressions do the work 
	instead.  
	 
	If a primitive is not optional, the comment will say, 'Essential'. Some 
	methods will have the comment, 'No Lookup'. See Object 
	howToModifyPrimitives for an explanation of special selectors which are 
	not looked up.  
	  
	For the primitives for +, -, *, and bitShift: in SmallInteger, and truncated 
	in Float, the primitive constructs and returns a 16-bit 
	LargePositiveInteger when the result warrants it. Returning 16-bit 
	LargePositiveIntegers from these primitives instead of failing is 
	optional in the same sense that the LargePositiveInteger arithmetic 
	primitives are optional. The comments in the SmallInteger primitives say, 
	'Fails if result is not a SmallInteger', even though the implementor has the 
	option to construct a LargePositiveInteger. For further information on 
	primitives, see the 'Primitive Methods' part of the chapter on the formal 
	specification of the interpreter in the Smalltalk book."
