unpin
	"The VM's garbage collector routinely moves objects as it reclaims and compacts
	 memory. But it can also pin an object so that it will not be moved, which can make
	 it easier to pass objects out through the FFI.  Objects are unpinnned when created.
	 This method ensures an object is unpinned, and answers whether it was pinned."
