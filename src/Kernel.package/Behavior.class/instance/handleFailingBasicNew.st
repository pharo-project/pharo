handleFailingBasicNew
	"handleFailingBasicNew gets sent after basicNew has failed and allowed
	 a scavenging garbage collection to occur.  The scavenging collection
	 will have happened as the VM is activating the (failing) basicNew.  If
	 handleFailingBasicNew fails then the scavenge failed to reclaim sufficient
	 space and a global garbage collection is required.  Retry after garbage
	 collecting and growing memory if necessary.

	 Primitive. Answer an instance of this class with the number of indexable
	 variables specified by the argument, sizeRequested.  Fail if this class is not
	 indexable or if the argument is not a positive Integer, or if there is not
	 enough memory available. Essential. See Object documentation whatIsAPrimitive."
