	"Answer whether the receiver has 8-bit instance variables.
	 Above Cog Spur the class format is
		<5 bits inst spec><16 bits inst size>
	 where the 5-bit inst spec is
			0	= 0 sized objects (UndefinedObject True False et al)
			1	= non-indexable objects with inst vars (Point et al)
			2	= indexable objects with no inst vars (Array et al)
			3	= indexable objects with inst vars (MethodContext AdditionalMethodState et al)
			4	= weak indexable objects with inst vars (WeakArray et al)
			5	= weak non-indexable objects with inst vars (ephemerons) (Ephemeron)
			6	= unused
			7	= immediates (SmallInteger, Character)
			8	= unused
			9	= 64-bit indexable
		10-11	= 32-bit indexable (Bitmap)
		12-15	= 16-bit indexable
		16-23	= 8-bit indexable
		24-31	= compiled methods (CompiledMethod)"
