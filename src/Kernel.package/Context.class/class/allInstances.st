enumerating
allInstances
	"Answer all instances of the receiver."
	<primitive: 177>
	"The primitive can fail because memory is low.  If so, fall back on the old
	 enumeration code, which gives the system a chance to GC and/or grow.
	 Because aBlock might change the class of inst (for example, using become:),
	 it is essential to compute next before aBlock value: inst.
	 Only count until thisContext since this context has been created only to
	 compute the existing instances."
