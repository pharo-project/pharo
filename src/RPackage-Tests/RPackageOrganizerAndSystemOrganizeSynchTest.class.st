"
Currently the system maintains 2 packages organisers. 
- RPackageOrganizer default
- SystemOrganizer default

Both of them should stay in synch and this test class will ensure that. 

Let's note that SystemOrganizer should vanish in the future so I'll probably vanish too, but in the meantime I'll ensure that we are in sync.
