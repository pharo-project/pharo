externalObjects
	"Return an array of objects that have been registered for use in non-Smalltalk code. Smalltalk objects should be referrenced by external code only via indirection through this array, thus allowing the objects to move during compaction. This array can be cleared when the VM re-starts, since variables in external code do not survive snapshots. Note that external code should not attempt to access a Smalltalk object, even via this mechanism, while garbage collection is in progress."
