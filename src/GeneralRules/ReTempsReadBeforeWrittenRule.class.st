"
Checks that all temporaries are assigned before they are used. This can help find possible paths through the code where a variable might be unassigned when it is used.

The rule detects, for example, when the assignment is done in a block that might not be executed. 

exampleMethod
	| temp |
	self doSomething: [ temp := 1].
	^temp.

As the rule can not know about the semantics of the method doSomething:, it assumes the block will not
be exected.

NOTE: This rule detects *many* false positives.
