"
This smell arises when a method is equivalent to its superclass method. The methods are equivalent when they have the same abstract syntax tree, except for variables names. Such method does not add anything to the computation and can be removed since the superclass method have the same behaviour. 

Furthermore, the methods #new and #initialize are ignored once they are often overridden for compatilbity with other platforms. The ignored methods can be edited in RBEquivalentSuperclassMethodsRule>>ignoredSelectors
