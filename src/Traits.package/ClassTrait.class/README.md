While every class has an associated metaclass, a trait can have an associated classtrait, an instance of me. To preserve metaclass compatibility, the associated classtrait (if there is one) is automatically applied to the metaclass, whenever a trait is applied to a class. Consequently, a trait with an associated classtrait can only be applied to classes, whereas a trait without a classtrait can be applied to both classes and metaclasses.
