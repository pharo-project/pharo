STONWriter serializes objects using the Smalltalk Object Notation format. 

Customization options are:

- prettyPrint <Boolean> default is false
	if true, produce pretty printed output
- newLine <String> default is String cr
	what sequence to use for EOL
- asciiOnly <Boolean> default is false
   if true, use \u escapes for all non-ASCII characters
   most common control characters are still escaped
- jsonMode <Boolean> default is false
	if true, the follow changes occur
	- strings are delimited with double quotes
	- nil is encoded as null
	- symbols are treated as strings
	- only STON listClass and STON mapClass instances are allowed as composite objects
	it is wise to also use either #error or #ignore as referencePolicy to avoid references
- referencePolicy <#normal|#ignore|#error> default is #normal
	if #normal, track and count object references and use references to implement sharing and break cycles
	if #error, track object references and signal STONWriterError when a shared reference is encountered
	if #ignore, don't track object references which might loop forever on cycles
 - keepNewLines <Boolean> default is false
	if true, any newline sequence CR, LF or CRLF inside strings or symbols will not be escaped 
	but will be written as the newline EOF convention
	
Note that in default STON mode I only use the following named character escapes: \b \t \n \f \' and \\ while in JSON mode \' is replaced by \"
