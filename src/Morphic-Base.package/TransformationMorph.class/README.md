A TransformationMorph is like a transformMorph, except that it does not clip, and its bounds include its entire submorph.  TransformationMorphs are assumed to have only one submorph -- the idea is that it is a wrapper that enables its submorph to scale and rotate.  A TransformationMorph may come to have more than one submorph if, eg, a menu sprouts a sub menu, using the transformationMorph temporarily as its world, but this ability is only sparsely supported (as in layoutChanged).
