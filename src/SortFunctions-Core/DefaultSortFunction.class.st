"
A DefaultSortFunction is a collator using the default threeWayCompareTo: operator.
It is known to work on String and Magnitude.

It is generally not useful to create a new instance, and the recommended pattern is to use the single instance available by sending the message  SortFunction default .

For other objects  that don't understand threeWayCompareTo: it is necessary to use a custom SortFunction rather than the default one.
