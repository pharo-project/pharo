	"
	Helper method for option parsing, used by the compiler (see pragma #compilerOptions:).
	
	Parse an array, which is a sequence of options in a form of: 
	
	#( + option1 option2 - option3 ... )
	
	each time the #+ is seen, the options which follow it will be subject for inclusion
	and, correspondingly, if #- seen, then they will be excluded	.

	By default, (if none of #+ or #- specified initially), all options are subject for inclusion.
