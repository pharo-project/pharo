A GLMPresentationUpdateRequest is announced by the presentation to notify the presentation that it should update it's content in a fast and non disrutive way. It is usually used in automatic refresh. A presentation can implement this the same way as #update, however it doesn't have to recompute it's content. Depending on its state the presentation can also ignore this request (for example it it is not visible on screen).
