This package contains a memory file system part of Pharo's FileSystem manager. 

It allow to emulate a file system directly into the memory of the computer. This memory file system can be used during tests for two reasons:
- To avoid to write temporary files (it will also help when Pharo is stored in a read only environment)
- To speed up the tests executions

A documentation of this library is available in the Deep Into Pharo book, «Chapter 3: Files with FileSystem».
