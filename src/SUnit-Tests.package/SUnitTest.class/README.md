This is both an example of writing tests and a self test for the SUnit. The tests 
here are pretty strange, since you want to make sure things blow up. You should 
not generally have to write tests this complicated in structure, although they 
will be far more complicated in terms of your own objects- more assertions, more 
complicated setup. Kent says: "Never forget, however, that if the tests are hard 
to write, something is probably wrong with the design".
