This announcement will be emitted when:
	=> a non-empty protocol is renamed in a class or a trait (using ClassOrganizer >> renameCategory:toBe:). If the protocol does not contain any method, the announcement will not be emitted. Therefore, if we rename a non-empty protocol, both SystemMethodRecategorizedAnnouncement and SystemClassReorganizedAnnouncement will be emitted
	=> a method is removed from a category of a class or a trait (using ClassOrganizer >> removeElement:)
	=> a method is RE-categorized in a protocol of a trait or a class, using Organizer>>classify:under:.  If the method is classify under its current protocol, the announcement will not be emitted
