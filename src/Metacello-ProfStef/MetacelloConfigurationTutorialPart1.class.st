"Version 0.1 represents the simplest version specification possible. 

In the method #version01, version 0.1 is defined with a single package ''Example-Core-anon.8'' 
that is loaded from the repository ''http://www.example.com/Example''.

Looking at this method you will notice a couple of things. 

Immediately after the method selector you see the pragma definition:

  <version: ''0.1''>

The pragma indicates that the version created in this method should be associated with version 
''0.1'' of the Tutorial project.

Looking a little closer you see that the argument to the method, <spec>, is the only variable in
the method and it is used as the receiver to four different messages:

  - #for:do:
  - #package:with:
  - #file: 
  - #repository:

With the evaluation of each block expression, a new object is pushed on a stack and the messages
within the block are sent to the object on the top of the stack.

So the method should be read as:

  Create version ''0.1''. The #common code for version ''0.1'' (#for:do:) consists of a package named 
  ''Example-Core'' (#package:with:) whose file attribute is ''Example-Core-anon.8'' (#file:) and whose 
  repository attribute is ''http://www.example.com/Example'' (#repository:).

We can see the spec created for version 0.1 by printing the following expression:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.1'') spec.

"Note that in creating version ''0.1'' the #common attribute is extracted out.

In addition to #common, there are pre-defined attributes for each of the platforms upon which
Metacello runs (#pharo, #gemstone and #squeakCommon). 

#squeakCommon is used for both #pharo and #squeak."

"For version 0.5 we''ve added an additional package to the mix: ''Example-AddOn'':"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.5'') spec.

"Of course, the point of specifiying packages in Metacello is to be able to load versions. Here are
a couple examples of loading versions of the Tutorial. If you print the result of each expression, 
you will see the list of packages in load order (note that for the tutorial, we are using the 
MetacelloNullRecordingMCSpecLoader. This class records which packages are loaded and the order that they are loaded in among other things instead of actually loading the packages."

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.1'') load.
  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.4'') load.
  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.5'') load.

"You will note that in each case, all of the packages associated with the version are loaded, which 
is the default. 

If you want to load a subset of the packages in a project, you may list the packages that you
are interested in as an argument to the #load: method:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.5'') load: { ''Example-Tests''. ''Example-Core'' }.

"Note that the ordering of the packages is based on the order in which the packages are specified.

If you evaluate the following expression:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.5'') load: { ''Example-Tests''. }.

"Only the package is ''Example-Tests''. By default the packages are ordered, but there are no implicit
dependencies."

"With version 0.6 we are mixing structural information (required packages and repository) with the
dynamic file version info. It is expected that over time the file version info will change from
version to version while the structural information will remain relatively static."

listed, the packages are listed and the required packages are defined. We''ll cover the #blessing:
in a later lesson.

In method #version07: the file versions are specified. You will note that the pragma as an #imports: component that specifies the list of versions that this version (version ''0.7'') is based upon. In 
fact, if you print the spec for ''0.7-baseline'' and then print the spec for ''0.7'' you can see that 
''0.7'' is a composition of both versions:"

   (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.7-baseline'') spec.

"Of course if you print the ''0.6'' spec and the ''0.7'' spec you can see that they specify exactly the
same information in a slightly different way:"

order:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.6'') load.
  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.7'') load.

"Finally, even though version ''0.7-baseline'' does not have explicit package versions, you may load
the version. When the ''real'' loader encounters a package name (without version information) it will
attempt to load the latest version of the package from the repository. With the
MetacelloNullRecordingMCSpecLoader the packages names are ''loaded'':"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''0.7-baseline'') load.

"Of course when a number of developers are working on a project it may be useful to load a
#baseline version so that you get the latest work from all of the project members. "

"In #baseline10: we''ve added two things: the ''Example-AddOnTests'' package and a specification for 
groups. 

The ''Example-AddOnTests'' package has been added to make the idea of needing to group packages a
little more appealing. The package requires ''Example-AddOn'' and ''Example-Tests''.

With two Test packages it would be convenient to be able to load all of the tests with a simple
expression like the following:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''1.0'') load: { ''Tests''. }.

"instead of having to explicitly list all of the test projects like this:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''1.0'') 
	load: { ''Example-Tests''. ''Example-AddOnTests''. }.

"This becomes especially useful if over time the project evolves to have more component and test 
packages.

The ''default'' group is special in that when a ''default'' group is defined, the #load method loads
the members of the ''default'' group instead of loading all of the packages:"

  (MetacelloTutorialConfig project version: ''1.0'') load.

"If you want to load all of the packages in a project, then the pseudo group ''ALL'' may be used as
follows:"

#baseline version:"
