"
I represent a code coverage session.

My instances can track the execution of methods and nodes and collects which are covered by execution and which are not.

Currently, compiled methods and sequences of statements (bodies of methods and block) can be tracked.
This is a compromise between efficency and precision that is good enough precition to track covered paths.

Here is a quick usage:

```
| collector coverage |
collector := CoverageCollector new. ""Instantiate""
collector methods: Point methods, Rectangle methods.  ""Configure with the methods to watch.""
coverage := collector runOn: [ (1@1 corner: 2@2) center ].  ""Setup, execute and teardown.""
(coverage methods includes: Point>>#x) >>> true.  ""Inspect the results""
(coverage nodes size > 10) >>> true. ""Covered paths are also available""
```

The `CoverageCollector>>#runOn:` methods is a high level method.
It calls the following fine grained methods in order:

* `CoverageCollector>>#install` to instrument the preselected methods
* `CoverageCollector>>#installOn:` to instrument the preselected methods ensuring `uninstall` is performed.
* `CoverageCollector>>#basicRun:` to watch the execution of a block.
* `CoverageCollector>>#uninstall` to remove the instrumentation on methods.
* `CoverageCollector>>#collectResult` to build and return a `CoverageResult` instance.
* `CoverageCollector>>#reset` to clear the annotation on executed methods.

Note: if `uninstall` is not called, some instrumentation may leaks.
You can use the global `CoverageCollector class>>#uninstallAll` to remove all instrumentation if needed.

Warning: because of the instrumentation, new instances of `CompiledMethod` can be created to replace existing one during the coverage computation. This means that the identity of method objects returned by expression like `Point>>#x` could be not reliable and that `=` and related methods may not behave as you expect if you use lower level methods.

	 * a sequence with a message send is connected to the main sequence of all methods with the same selector.

	 Note that only the `nodes` from the `methods`	are considered, so the resulting graph may not be connected.
