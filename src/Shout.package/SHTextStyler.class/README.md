I am an Abstract class.
Subclasses of me can create formatted, coloured, and styled copies of Text that is given to them.
They may perform their styling asynchronously, in a background process which I create and manage.

My public interface is...

	view: aViewOrMorph - set the view that will receive notifications when styling has completed.
	
	format: aText - modifies aText's string

	style: aText - modifies the TextAttributes of aText, but does not change the string, then sends #stylerStyled: to the view.

	styleInBackgroundProcess: aText - performs style: in a background process, then sends #stylerStylednBackground: to the view.

	styledTextFor: aText - answers a formatted and styled copy of aText

	unstyledTextFrom: aText - answers a copy of aText with all TextAttributes removed

Subclasses of me should re-implement...

	privateFormat: aText - answer a formatted version of aText; the String may be changed
	privateStyle: aText - modify the TextAttributes of aText; but do not change the String
