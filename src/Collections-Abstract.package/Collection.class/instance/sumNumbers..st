sumNumbers: aBlock
	"This is implemented using a variant of the normal inject:into: pattern
	that is specific to handling numbers. aBlock is expected to return a number
	for every element in the collection.
	
	Different from the sum: implementation, the default value is zero. While sum: is 
	more general, sumNumbers: is meant to support the most often encountered use case of
	dealing with numbers."
