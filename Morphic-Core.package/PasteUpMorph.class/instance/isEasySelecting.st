isEasySelecting
	"This is to isolate easySelection predicate. 
	Selectors in holders make no sense so we are limiting easy
	selection to the worldMorph.
	It would also make sense in playfield so feel free to adjust this
	predicate. Selection can always be forced by using the shift
	before mouse down."
