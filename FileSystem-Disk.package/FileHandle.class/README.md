I provide an interface for doing IO on an open file. I keep an id, which as an opaque identifier used by the FilePlugin primitives. I translate positions from the 1-based indexes used in Smalltalk to the 0-based offsets used by the primitives.

I do not implement the primitives myself, instead delegating those to an instance of FilePluginPrimitives.
