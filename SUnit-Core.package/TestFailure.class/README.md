The test framework distinguishes between failures and errors.  A failure is an event whose possibiity is explicitly anticipated and checked for in an assertion, whereas an error is an unanticipated problem like a division by 0 or an index out of bounds.  TestFailure is raised when the boolean parameter of an assert: ... or deny: ... call is the opposite of what the assertion claims.
