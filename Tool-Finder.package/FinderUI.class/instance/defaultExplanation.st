'The Finder can be used in 4 different ways:
	- Selectors: your research is done among selectors
	- Classes : your research is done among classes names
	- Source : your research is done among all the source code
	- Pragmas: your research is done among pragmas
	- Examples : your research uses the Method Finder behavior 
			   (for further informations, print ''FinderUI methodFinderExplanation'')
	
			
In these four modes, you can also tick the ''Use RegEx'' checkbox.
If you pick this box, your search will be done using regular expressions instead of just matching.

The ''Select classes'' button opened a dialog window  to select which classes will be used for the search.
The ''All classes'' button is used to reset the classes selection.'
