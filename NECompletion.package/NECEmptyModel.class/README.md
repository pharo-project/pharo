I am an empty completion Model. I am used if no completion is expected.

For example, typing a message send and using constants (Strings/Numbers) for the arguments,
we don't want to complete the constant arguments with any exisiting symbol containing that constant:
3 + 12 
should not show completion menu with entries like CP1250TextConverter, ExampleForTest12, ...
