		contents: 'Pharo 5.0 already comes pre-loaded with a rich set of packages that you can use to explore the system and develop your own applications. However there is also a huge library of user contributed projects that you can also load using the "Catalog Browser" by highlighting the next line and selecting [Do it] from the context menu:

CatalogBrowser open.

This browser is also accessible from the World>Tools>Catalog Browser menu (just click the desktop, select Tools, and then Catalog Browser).

Catalog projects can also be browsed online: 

http://catalog.pharo.org

You can also have a rough list (not very friendly) of many packages available stored in smalltalkhub 
repository:

http://smalltalkhub.com/list

(this list is not a compendium of packages for Pharo but is a good place to start if looking for 
something in particular and is not in the catalog)
