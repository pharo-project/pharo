*Tool-Profilers
profileStart: counter
	"Primitive. Begin profiling execution every by using the interrupt check-counter instead of a time-based process (which is limited to timing resolution and triggers off the same signal that many of the processes being profiled trigger off leading to consistently wrong results).
	The argument is the number of interrupt checks (method activations) to let go by before taking a sample. The sample is being stored in the profileSample iVar which can be retrieved by executing primitiveProfileSample. When a sample is taken, it signals the semaphore specified in primitiveProfileSemaphore.
	If the argument is less or equal to zero, it disables profiling."
