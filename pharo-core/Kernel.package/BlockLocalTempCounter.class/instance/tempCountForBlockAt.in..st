	"Compute the number of local temporaries in a block.
	 If the block begins with a sequence of push: nil bytecodes then some of
	 These could be initializing local temps.  We can only reliably disambuguate
	 them from other uses of nil by parsing the stack and seeing what the offset
	 of the stack pointer is at the end of the block.

	 There are short-cuts.  The ones we take here are
		- if there is no sequence of push nils there can be no local temps
		- we follow forward jumps to shorten the amount of scanning"
