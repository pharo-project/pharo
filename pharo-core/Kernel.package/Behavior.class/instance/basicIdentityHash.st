basicIdentityHash
	"Answer a SmallInteger whose value is related to the receiver's identity.
	 Behavior implements identityHash to allow the VM to use an object representation which
	 does not include a direct reference to an object's class in an object.  If the VM is using
	 this implementation then classes are held in a class table and instances contain the index
	 of their class in the table.  A class's class table index is its identityHash so that an instance
	 can be created without searching the table for a class's index.  The VM uses this primitive
	 to enter the class into the class table, assigning its identityHash with an as yet unused
	 class table index. If this primitive fails it means that the class table is full.  In Spur as of
	 2014 there are 22 bits of classTable index and 22 bits of identityHash per object.

	 Primitive. Essential. Do not override. See Object documentation whatIsAPrimitive."
