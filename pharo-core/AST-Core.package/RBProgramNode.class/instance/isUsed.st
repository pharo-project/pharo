isUsed
	"Answer true if this node could be used as part of another expression. For example, you could use the 
	result of this node as a receiver of a message, an argument, the right part of an assignment, or the 
	return value of a block. This differs from isDirectlyUsed in that it is conservative since it also includes 
	return values of blocks."
