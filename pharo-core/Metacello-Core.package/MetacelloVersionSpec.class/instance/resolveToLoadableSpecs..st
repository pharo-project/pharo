  "Resolves names in namelist to the  list of packages and projects in the version that would be loaded. Projects are 
	not traversed during the transitive closure. The scope is that of the version itself.
	   If the spec is a package, answer a list including the package and the transitive closure on 
			its #requires: and #includes: fields.
	   If the spec is a project, answer the project.
	   If the spec is a group, answers the list of packages in the #includes: field of the group. 
			Groups in the #includes: field are expanded following the transitive closure on groups"
