# World Menu ItemsThe World Menu is accessible by clicking on the background of Pharo. The menu provides shortcuts to launch tools. New menu items can be easily added. This overview gives the basic instruction how.## Adding a menu itemConsider you have a class `GAPlugin`. You can add a world menu item with the following _class-side_ method:```GAPlugin class >> menuCommandOn: aBuilder	<worldMenu>	(aBuilder item: #GeneticAlgo) action: [ 42 inspect ]```What is key there is that you class method is annotated with the `<worldMenu>` pragma.
The code given above creates a menu entry called `GeneticAlgo`. 

Selecting this item executes the code provided to `action:` message. ## Adding submenus
 Submenus can also be created:```GAPlugin class>>menuCommandOn: aBuilder	<worldMenu>	aBuilder item: #GeneticAlgo.		((aBuilder		item: 'Loading Graphical Examples';		parent: #GeneticAlgo))	action: [ 42 inspect ]```The code above creates a menu in the world menu and add an entry into it.
