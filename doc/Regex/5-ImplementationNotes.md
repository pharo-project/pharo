## What To Look At First
- `String>>#matchesRegex:` in 90% cases this method is all you need to
access the package.
- `RxParser`: accepts a string or a stream of characters with a regular
expression, and produces a syntax tree corresponding to the
expression. The tree is made of instances of Rxs<whatever> classes.
- `RxMatcher`: accepts a syntax tree of a regular expression built by
the parser and compiles it into a matcher: a structure made of
instances of Rxm<whatever> classes. The `RxMatcher` instance can test
whether a string or a positionable stream of characters matches the
original regular expression, or search a string or a stream for
substrings matching the expression. After a match is found, the
matcher can report a specific string that matched the whole
expression, or any parenthesized subexpression of it.
- All other classes support the above functionality and are used by
`RxParser`, `RxMatcher`, or both.

## Caveats
The matcher is similar in spirit, but NOT in the design — let alone the
code — to the original Henry Spencer's regular expression
implementation in C.  The focus is on simplicity, not on efficiency.
I didn't optimize or profile anything.  I may in future — or I may not:
I do this in my spare time and I don't promise anything.
The matcher passes H. Spencer's test suite (see 'test suite'
protocol), with quite a few extra tests added, so chances are good
there are not too many bugs.  But watch out anyway.

##Extensions, Future, etc.
With the existing separation between the parser, the syntax tree, and
the matcher, it is easy to extend the system with other matchers based
on other algorithms.
