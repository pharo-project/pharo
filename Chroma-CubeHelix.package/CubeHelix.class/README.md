My instances represent a color gradient in the CubeHelix family.

	CubeHelix new at: someValueBetweenZeroAndOne

CubeHelix is a formula for color gradients which ensure a continuous increase in perceived intensity from black to white, with hue variations that increase  by following a tapered spiral around the diagonal of the RGB color cube. Converting the gradient back to grayscale produces a linear gradient.
