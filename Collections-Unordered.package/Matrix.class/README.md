I represent a mathematical matrix or a two-dimensional array. I provide methods for creating matrices, operating on them arithmetically and algebraically. 

Structure:
 - numberOfRows : a non-negative integer saying how many rows there are.
 - numberOfColumns : a non-negative integer saying how many columns there are.
 - contents : an Array holding the elements in row-major order.  That is, for a 2x3 array the contents are (11 12 13 21 22 23).  


Element-wise matrix arithmetic works; you can freely mix matrices and numbers but
don't try to mix matrices and arrays (yet).
Matrix multiplication, using the symbol +* (derived from APL's +.x), works between
(Matrix or Array) +* (Matrix or Array).  Don't try to use a number as an argument of +*.
Matrix * Number and Number * Matrix work fine, so you don't need +* with numbers.
