I am a visitor that collects objects from the nodes I visit. I take a block similar to those passed to Collection>>collect:. I evaluate the block with DirectoryEntries for the nodes I visit, and collect the objects answered into an array.

I can use any guide, and the objects in the array I produce will reflect the order imposed by the guide.
