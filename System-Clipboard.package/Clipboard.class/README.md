The Clipboard class is the abstract superclass for the concrete platform specific clipboard. The legacy clipboard support using the VM supplied primitives is implemented by Clipboard/ExternalClipboard.

The Clipboard implements a basic buffering scheme for text. The currently selected text is also exported to the OS so that text can be copied from and to other applications. Commonly only a single instance is used (the default clipboard) but applications are free to use other than the default clipboard if necessary.
