This class implements the MD5 128-bit one-way hash function.  It relies on
the ThirtyTwoBitRegister class supplied as part of the "Digital Signatures"
functionality included in Squeak 2.7.  As of this date (1/20/2000), the
U.S. Government has lifted many of the previous restrictions on the export
of encryption software, but you should check before exporting anything
including this code.  MD5 is commonly used for some secure Internet
protocols, including authentication in HTTP, which is why I wrote it.
